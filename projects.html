    <h2>E-commerce Profitability Analysis & Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>
        In retail and e-commerce, high sales volume does not always translate into high profit.
        This project analyzes transaction-level data to identify the key drivers of profitability
        and evaluates machine learning models to understand and predict profit behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Dataset:</strong><br>
        Real-world e-commerce transaction data containing order details, product categories,
        discount information, regional data, and profit metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Approach:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling encoding issues and date features</li>
        <li>Conducted exploratory data analysis to study sales, profit distribution, and discount impact</li>
        <li>Identified loss-making transactions and analyzed their relationship with discounts and order size</li>
        <li>Engineered business-driven features such as high-discount flags, shipping delay, and seasonality</li>
        <li>Prepared data for modeling with proper encoding and train–test splitting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression (baseline and interpretability)</li>
        <li>Decision Tree Regressor (non-linear relationships)</li>
        <li>Random Forest Regressor (ensemble model)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong><br>
        RMSE, MAE, and R² were used to compare model performance and understand prediction limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>High discounts (above ~40%) consistently resulted in negative profit</li>
        <li>Sales volume alone did not guarantee profitability</li>
        <li>Technology products generated the highest average profit</li>
        <li>Furniture sub-categories such as tables contributed disproportionately to losses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Business Recommendations:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limit aggressive discounting and apply discounts strategically</li>
        <li>Focus marketing and inventory on high-margin product categories</li>
        <li>Reassess pricing and sourcing strategies for consistently loss-making products</li>
        <li>Use ML models as decision-support tools rather than automated profit predictors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong><br>
        Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Git, Jupyter Notebook
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
        While profit proved difficult to predict precisely due to missing cost-related variables,
        the analysis delivered strong business insights and highlighted the importance of data
        quality and domain understanding over model complexity.
